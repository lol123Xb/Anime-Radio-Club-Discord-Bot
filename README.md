## Dependencies
These are the stuff you'll have to install before doing anything

* `discord.js`, if it wasn't obvious enough

## MAIN ACCOUNT WAS HACKED AND DELETED BY HACKER IN 2021
As stated, main account was hacked and deleted so this bot will not be found through any Discord Bot listing sites anymore as I am too lazy to remake the support server and such so only thing I'll do is update the invite link and feel free to invite the new bot I created for this if you want. 

TL;DR: Basically remade bot, feel free to use invite link
