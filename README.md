# WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THIS BOT MAKE A COMEBACK?
Head over to this [strawpoll](https://strawpoll.com/NPgxe8PXQZ2) and hit yes if so

# Selling website domain and possibly full code with all radio stations on the bot
I am no longer working on updating this bot and due to that, and Discord's unwillingness to be helpful in any way, I have decided to just entirely give up on this bot (I will keep it running, but if interest in this bot dies out then I will shut it off forever), so now I am selling the domain for the website and I may sell the code with all radio stations on it, depends on interest.

Head to [here](http://animeradioclub.com) to purchase the domain

## MAIN ACCOUNT WAS HACKED AND DELETED BY HACKER IN 2021
As stated, main account was hacked and deleted so this bot will not be found through any Discord Bot listing sites anymore as I am too lazy to remake the support server and such so only thing I'll do is update the invite link and feel free to invite the new bot I created for this if you want. 

TL;DR: Basically remade bot, feel free to use invite link
